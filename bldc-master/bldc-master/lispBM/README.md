# LispBM

This is the VESC-integration of [lispBM](https://github.com/svenssonjoel/lispBM) written by Joel Svensson. It allows the VESC to run lisp-programs in a sandboxed environment.

### Feature Overview

* Development and testing in VESC Tool with variable live monitoring and plotting as well as CPU and memory monitoring.
* There is a REPL in VESC Tool where code can be executed and tested live. You even have full access to the functions and bindings in the program you have uploaded.
* Sandboxed environment, meaning that the Lisp code (hopefully) cannot freeze or crash the rest of the VESC code when it gets stuck or runs out of heap or stack memory.
* The application runs on the VESC itself without the need for having VESC Tool connected and is stored in flash memory.
* When a lisp-application is written to the VESC it is automatically started on each boot.

## Language Reference

[LispBM Language Reference](lispBM/doc/lbmref.md)

## Programming Manual

This is the work-in-progress programming manual for LispBM. Note that the examples in the manual use the REPL quite a lot. All of them also work in the VESC Tool REPL (which is below the console below the code editor) when you are connected to a VESC and will be executed on the VESC itself. The results of the commands will be printed in the console. From the VESC Tool REPL you also have access to all functions and variables in the program that you have uploaded to the VESC.

## VESC-Specific Commands and Extensions

The VESC-specific extensions are documented below. If you are reading this on GitHub there is an index in the upper left corner that can be used to navigate this document. It follows you as you scroll around and also includes a search function that filters all the titles in this document.

Note that VESC Tool includes a collection of examples that can be used as a starting point for using LispBM on the VESC.

### Various Commands

#### print

```clj
(print arg1 ... argN)
```

Print to the VESC Tool Lisp console. Example:

```clj
(print "Hello World")
```

Should work for all types.

#### timeout-reset

```clj
(timeout-reset)
```

Reset the timeout that stops the motor. This has to be run on at least every second to keep the motor running. The timeout time can be configured in App Settings->General. The [Motor Set Commands](#motor-set-commands) will also reset the timeout when they are called.

#### get-ppm

```clj
(get-ppm)
```

Read the decoded value on the PPM input and returns 0.0 to 1.0. Note that the PPM app has to be configured and running. Example:

```clj
(print (list "PPM Value: " (get-ppm)))
```

Note that control type can be set to Off in the PPM app to get the input without running the motor automatically, which is useful when running the motor from lisp.

#### get-ppm-age

```

Get ADC voltage on channel ch (0, 1 or 2).

#### get-adc-decoded

```clj
(get-adc-decoded ch)
```

Get decoded ADC value on channel ch (0 or 1). Decoded means that the voltage is mapped to the range 0 to 1 according to the configuration in the ADC app. Note that the ADC app must be running for this function to work. No throttle curve is applied to this value, but you can use the [throttle-curve](#throttle-curve) function to apply one if desired.

(sleep 0.05) ; Sleep for 0.05 seconds (50 ms)
```

#### get-remote-state

```clj
(get-remote-state)
```

Get button and joystick state of connected remote. Note that a remote app such as the VESC remote or nunchuk must be configured and running for this to work. Returns the following list:

```clj

(sysinfo 'git-branch) ; Git branch name
(sysinfo 'git-hash) ; Git hash of current commit
(sysinfo 'compiler) ; GCC version, e.g. 7.3.1
```

### App Override Commands

Several app-inputs can be detached from the external interfaces and overridden from lisp. This is useful to take advantage of existing throttle curves and control modes from the apps while providing a custom input source.

#### app-adc-detach

```clj
(app-adc-detach mode state)
; Where
; mode : Select periperial to detach from APP
;        - 0 All peripherial attached (no second argument)
;        - 1 ADC1/2
;        - 2 Buttons
;        - 3 ADC1/2 + Buttons
; state : Only when mode 1/2/3/4 - 1 detaches periperial from APP, 0 attaches peripherial to APP 
```

Detaches a peripherial from the APP ADC

#### app-adc-override

```clj
(app-adc-override mode value)
; Where
; mode : Select periperial to override
;        - 0 ADC1
;        - 1 ADC2
;        - 2 Reverse button
;        - 3 Cruise control button
; val : 0.0 to 1.0 (button pressed is > 0.0)
```

Sets the override value

#### app-ppm-detach

```clj
(app-ppm-detach state)
```

Detaches the decoded ppm signal from APP PPM. 1 means detach, 0 means attach.

#### app-ppm-override

```clj
(app-ppm-override value)
```

Sets the override value. Range -1.0 to 1.0.

#### set-remote-state

```clj
(set-remote-state js-y js-x bt-c bt-z is-rev)
; Where
; js-y : Joystick Y axis, range -1.0 to 1.0, used for throttle position
; js-x : Joystick X axis, range -1.0 to 1.0, unused by the app
; bt-c : C button pressed state, 0 or 1, used for cruise control
; bt-z : Z button pressed state, 0 or 1, unused by the app
; is-rev : Reverse active, 0 or 1, reverse mode active
```

Send input to the VESC Remote app. Unlike the ADC and PPM apps, input can be sent to this app at any time without detaching it and it will be treated the same as a packet from a VESC Remote. That means the timeout as well as all VESC Remote settings will be used.

### Motor Set Commands

#### set-current

```clj
(set-current current optOffDelay)
```

Set motor current in amperes.

The optional optOffDelay argument (in seconds) will delay turning off the modulation when setting 0 current. This is useful when running e.g. a control loop that will end up setting 0 current in some circumstances when turning off the modulation would make the control less smooth. The delay value should be longer than the rate at which the control loop runs.

#### set-current-rel

```clj
(set-current-rel current optOffDelay)
```

Set motor current relative to the maximum current. Range -1 to 1. For example, if the maximum current is set to 50A, (set-current-rel 0.5) will set the current to 25A.

See [set-current](#set-current) for details on what the optional argument optOffDelay does.

#### set-duty
```clj
(set-duty dutycycle)
```

Set duty cycle. Range -1.0 to 1.0.

#### set-brake
```clj
(set-brake current)
```

Set braking current.

```

Same as set-handbrake, but with a current relative to the maximum current in the range 0.0 to 1.0.

#### set-rpm
```clj
(set-rpm rpm)
```

Set RPM speed control.

#### set-pos

Negative curve constants mean that the throttle will be gentler in the beginning and more aggressive with towards the end and positive curve constants mean the opposite. The modes are 0: Exponential, 1: Natural and 2: Polynomial. You can have a look at the throttle curves in VESC Tool for the PPM, ADC or VESC Remote app and experiment with the mode and curve constants to see a plot of the response.

### Bit Operations

#### bits-enc-int
```clj
(bits-enc-int initial offset number bits)
```

Put bits of number in initial at offset and return the result. For example, if the bits initial are aaaaaaaa, number is bbb, offset is 2 and bits is 3 the result is aaabbbaa. For reference, the corresponding operation in C is:

Example for reading phase B on motor 1 as raw ADC values:

```clj
(raw-adc-current 1 2 1)
```

#### raw-adc-voltage

#### raw-hall
```clj
(raw-hall motor optSamples)
```
Read hall sensors for motor (1 or 2) and return their states in a list. The optional argument optSamples (max 20) can be used to set how many times the hall sensors are sampled; if it is not supplied the number of samples from the motor configuration will be used.

The function (ix list ind) can be used to get an element from the list. Example:

(ix (raw-hall 1) 0) ; Get hall sensor 1 state (index 0)
```

### UART

#### uart-start

```clj
(uart-start baudrate optHd)
```

Start the UART driver at baudrate on the COMM-port on the VESC. optHd is an optional argument that can be set to 'half-duplex to use half-duplex mode. In half-duplex mode only the tx-pin is used. If any app is using the UART pins it will be stopped first. Example:

```clj
(uart-start 115200) ; Start UART at 115200 baud in full duplex mode
(uart-start 115200 'half-duplex) ; Start UART at 115200 baud in half duplex mode
```

#### uart-write

```clj
(uart-write array)
```

Write array (see [byte array](#byte-arrays) for details) to the UART. Examples:

```clj
(uart-write "Hello World!") ; Write the string hello world!
```

```clj
(define arr (array-create 6)) ; Create a 6 byte long array
(bufset-i16 arr 0 1123) ; Set byte 0 and 1 to 1123
(bufset-i32 arr 2 424242) ; Set byte 2 to 5 to 424242 
(uart-write arr) ; Write arr to the uart
```

#### uart-read

```clj
(uart-read array num optOffset optStopAt)
```

Read num bytes into array at offset optOffset. Stop reading if the character optStopAt is received. The last two arguments are optional. Note that this function returns immediately if there is nothing to be read, so it is not blocking. The return value is the number of bytes read.

#### uart-read-bytes

```clj
(uart-read-bytes array num offset)
```

Read num bytes into buffer at offset. This function is blocking, so it will not return until the specified amount of bytes is read.

#### uart-read-until

```clj
(uart-read-until array num offset end)
```

Same as uart-read-bytes, but will return when the byte end is read.

### I2C

(i2c-start optRate optPinSda optPinScl)
```

Start the I2C driver on the COMM-port on the VESC. If any app is using the I2C pins it will be stopped first. optRate is an optional argument for the I2C bitrate. optPinSda and optPinScl are optional arguments for using different SDA and SCL pins. Example:

```clj
(i2c-start 'rate-400k) ; 400 kbps and the default SDA and SDC pins
(i2c-start 'rate-100k 'pin-swdio 'pin-swclk) ; 100 kbps and SWDIO and SWCLK as SDA and SCL

; Available bitrates
'rate-100k
'rate-200k
'rate-400k
'rate-700k

; Available pins
'pin-rx
'pin-tx
'pin-swdio
'pin-swclk
'pin-hall1
'pin-hall2
'pin-hall3
```

#### i2c-tx-rx

```clj
(i2c-tx-rx addr arrTx optArrRx)
```

Send array (or list) arrTx to the I2C-device with address addr. Optionally receive a response to opArrRx. Example:

```clj
; Create 14 byte long array
(define arr (array-create 14))

; Send 0x3B to device 0x68 and receive 14 bytes into arr
(i2c-tx-rx 0x68 (list 0x3B) arr)
```

#### i2c-restore

```clj
(i2c-restore)
```

Sends a sequence of bits in an attempt to restore the i2c-bus. Can be used if an i2c-device hangs and refuses to respond.

### GPIO

These functions allow using GPIO-pins from lispBM. The UART and SWD pins can currently be used. NOTE: If you are using the SWD-pins a SWD-programmer won't work after that until the next reset. If you are using the hall sensor pins make sure that sensor port mode is not set to anything that will communicate with encoders using those pins. Leaving the sensor port in hall sensor mode should be fine.

#### gpio-configure

```clj
(gpio-configure pin mode)
```

Configure GPIO pin to mode. Example:

```clj
(gpio-configure 'pin-rx 'pin-mode-out) ; Set pin RX to output

; Available pins
'pin-rx     ; RX-pin on the COMM-port
'pin-tx     ; TX-pin on the COMM-port
'pin-swdio  ; IO-pin on the SWD-port
'pin-swclk  ; CLK-pin on the SWD-port
'pin-hall1  ; Sensor port hall1
'pin-hall2  ; Sensor port hall2
'pin-hall3  ; Sensor port hall3
'pin-adc1   ; ADC1-pin on COMM-port
'pin-adc2   ; ADC2-pin on COMM-port
'pin-ppm    ; Signal-pin on PPM-port

; Available modes
'pin-mode-out    ; Output
'pin-mode-od     ; Open drain output
'pin-mode-od-pu  ; Open drain output with pull-up
'pin-mode-od-pd  ; Open drain output with pull-down
'pin-mode-in     ; Input
'pin-mode-in-pu  ; Input with pull-up
'pin-mode-in-pd  ; Input with pull-down
'pin-mode-analog ; Analog (NOTE: only works on the ADC-pins)
```

#### gpio-write

```clj
(gpio-write pin state)
```

Write state to pin. If the pin is set to an output 1 will set it to VCC and 0 to GND. If the pin is open drain 1 will set it floating and 0 will set it to GND. Example:

```clj
(gpio-write 'pin-rx 1) ; Set pin rx to 1
```

#### gpio-read

```clj
(gpio-read pin)
```

Read state of pin. Returns 1 if the pin is high, 0 otherwise.

### Configuration

The following selection of app and motor parameters can be read and set from LispBM:

```

#### conf-set

```clj
(conf-set param value)
```

Set param to value. This can be done while the motor is running and it will be applied instantly. Note that the parameter won't be stored in flash, so it will be back to the old value on the next boot. To store all parameters that have been changed you can use [conf-store](#conf-store). Example:

```clj
(conf-set 'max-speed (/ 25 3.6)) ; Set the maximum speed to 25 km/h
```

#### conf-get

```clj
(conf-get param optDefLim)
```

Get the value of param. optDefLim is an optional argument that can be set to 1 or 2; 1 means get the default value and 2 means get the limit value. Example:

```clj
(conf-get 'foc-motor-r) ; Get the motor resistance in milliOhm
(conf-get 'controller-id 1) ; Get the default CAN ID of this VESC
(conf-get 'l-current-max 2) ; Get the maximum allowed current on this hardware
```

#### conf-store

```clj
(conf-store)
```

Store the current configuration to flash. This will stop the motor.

#### conf-detect-foc

```clj
(conf-detect-foc canFwd maxLoss minCurrIn maxCurrIn openloopErpm slErpm)
```

Run the same autodetection as the wizard in VESC Tool does. This function will block the current lispBM-thread until in finishes (other threads will continue running). Arguments:

```clj
canFwd       ; Scan CAN-bus and detect on all VESCs found on CAN-bus
maxLoss      ; Maximum power loss in W to derive current limit from
minCurrIn    ; Minimum input current in A (negative value)
maxCurrIn    ; Maximum input current in A
openLoopErpm ; Openlopp ERPM setting
slErpm       ; Sensorless ERPM setting
```

Result:

```clj
  0 ; OK and no sensors found
  1 ; OK and hall sensors found
  2 ; OK and AS5047 found
 -1 ; Fault code during sensor detection
-10 ; Flux linkage detection failed
-50 ; CAN-detection failed
-51 ; CAN-detection timed out
```

Example:

```clj
; No can detection, 50w losses max, -20 A to 50 A input current, 800 ERPM openloop and 2500 erpm for sensorless in case sensors are found
(print (conf-detect-foc 0 50 -20 50 800 2500))
; Print the result when done
```

#### conf-set-pid-offset

```clj
(conf-set-pid-offset offset optStore)
```

Set the PID controller offset such that the current angle becomes offset. This can be used in position control applications when e.g. homing against a limit switch. The optional argument optStore can be set to 1 to store the offset persistently (although that requires stopping the motor).

#### conf-measure-res

```clj
(conf-measure-res current optSamples)
```

Measure motor resistance with current. The optional argument optSamples sets the number of samples to use (default 100).

This command is useful to update the configuration before starting the motor as the resistance is the most important when it comes to sensorless low-speed performance. It is also useful to sanity check if the motor is shorted out or if a connector is loose. Such faults cause a relatively significant change in resistance. Changes with more than 50% compared to the detected value are most likely faults.

**NOTE:** Phase filters are required to get accurate resistance measurements, so resistance-based fault detection is not as useful on hardware without phase filters.

### EEPROM (Nonvolatile Storage)

Up to 128 variables (int32 or float) can be stored in a nonvolatile memory reserved for LispBM. These variables persist between power cycles and configuration changes, but not between firmware updates. Keep in mind that the motor will be stopped briefly when writing them and that they only can be written a limited number of times (about 100 000 writes) before wear on the flash memory starts to become an issue.

#### eeprom-store-f

```clj
(eeprom-store-f addr number)
```

Store float number on emulated eeprom at address addr. Addr range: 0 to 127. Note that this will stop the motor briefly as writing to the flash memory cannot be done at the same time as the motor is running.

#### eeprom-read-f

```clj
(eeprom-read-f addr)
```

Read float number on emulated eeprom at address addr. Addr range: 0 to 127. If nothing was stored on that address this function returns nil.

#### eeprom-store-i

```clj
(eeprom-store-i addr number)
```

Same as eeprom-store-f, but store number as i32 instead of float.

#### eeprom-read-i

```clj
(eeprom-read-i addr)
```

Same as eeprom-read-i, but read number as i32 instead of float.

### Loops

#### loopfor

```clj
(loopfor it start cond update body)
```

For-loop. it is the iterator, start is what it is initialized to, cond is the condition that has the be true for the loop to continue running, update is how to update the iterator after each iteration and body is the code to execute each iteration. The iterator can be accessed from within body. Example:

```clj
(loopfor i 0 (< i 5) (+ i 1)
    (print i)
)

Output:
0
1
2
3
4

; Remember that multiple statements in the loop require a progn:
(loopfor i 0 (< i 5) (+ i 1)
    (progn
        (print i)
        (sleep 0.5)
))
```

#### loopwhile

```clj
(loopwhile cond body)
```

While-loop. cond is the condition that has the be true for the loop to continue running and body is the code to execute each iteration. Example:

```clj
(define i 0)

(loopwhile (< i 5)
    (progn
        (print i)
        (define i (+ i 1))
))

Output:
0
1
2
3
4
```

Another example that prints "Hello World" every two seconds:

```clj
(loopwhile t
    (progn
        (print "Hello World")
        (sleep 2)
))
```

#### looprange

```clj
(looprange it start end body)
```

Range-loop. Iterate it from start to end and evaluate body for each iteration. The iterator it can be accessed from within body. Example:

```clj
(looprange i 0 5
    (print i)
)

Output:
0
1
2
3
4

; As with the other loops, multiple statements require a progn
(looprange i 0 5
    (progn
        (print i)
        (sleep 0.5)
))
```

#### loopforeach

```clj
(loopforeach it lst body)
```

ForEach-loop. Iterate over every element in the list lst and evaluate body for each iteration. The iterator it can be accessed from within body. Example:

```clj
(loopforeach i '("AB" "C" "dE" "f")
    (print i)
)

Output:
AB
C
dE
f

; As with the other loops, multiple statements require a progn
(loopforeach i '("AB" "C" "dE" "f")
    (progn
        (print i)
        (sleep 0.5)
))

```

#### break

```clj
(break retval)
```

break can be used to break out of a loop and return retval (the result of the loop will be retval, otherwise the result of the loop will be the result of the last expression in it). break works in all of the loops above. Example:

```clj
; Below we make a function to determine if
; the list lst contains number num

(defun contains (num lst)
    (loopforeach it lst
        (if (= it num)
            (break t)
            nil
)))

(contains 346 '(12 33 452 11 22 346 99 12))
> t

(contains 347 '(12 33 452 11 22 346 99 12))
> nil
```

### Useful Lisp Functions

There are a number of lisp functions that can be used from lispBM in the VESC firmware. They will be loaded to the environment the first time they are used, so they do not use up memory before the first use.

#### defun

```clj
(defun (args) body)
```

Shorthand macro for defining a function. Example:

```clj
; Create function f with argument x that prints x
(defun f (x)
    (print x)
)

; The above is equivalent to
(define f (lambda (x)
    (print x)
))
```

#### map

```clj
(map f lst)
```

Apply function f to every element in list lst. Example:

```clj
(map (lambda (x) (* x 5)) '(1 2 3 4))
> (5 10 15 20)
```

This example creates an anonymous function that takes one argument and returns that argument multiplied by 5. Map then applies it to every element in the list (1 2 3 4), which yields the list (5 10 15 20).

#### iota

```clj
(iota n)
```

Create list from 0 to n, excluding n. Example:

```clj
(iota 5)
> (0 1 2 3 4)
```

#### range

```clj
(range start end)
```

Create a list from start to end, excluding end. Example:

```clj
(range 2 8)
> (2 3 4 5 6 7)
```

#### foldl

```clj
(foldl f init lst)
```

Apply the function f to pairs of init and each element of the list lst and accumulate the result. Example:

```clj
(foldl + 0 '(1 2 3 4 5))
> 15
```

#### foldr

Same as foldl, but start from the right side of lst.

#### reverse

```clj
(reverse lst)
```

Returns the list lst in reverse. Example:

```clj
(reverse '(1 2 3 4 5))
> (5 4 3 2 1)
```

#### length

```clj
(length lst)
```

Returns the length of list lst. Example:

```clj
(length '(1 2 3))
> 3
```

#### apply

```clj
(apply f lst)
```

Use the elements in list lst as arguments to function f. Example:

```clj
(apply + '(1 2 3))
> 6
```

#### zipwith

```clj
(zipwith f x y)
```

Apply the function f to pairs between the elements in list x and list y. Example:

```clj
(zipwith * '(1 2 3) '(3 4 5))
> (3 8 15)
```

#### filter

```clj
(filter f lst)
```

Filter list by keeping the elements on which f returns true. Example:

```clj
(filter (lambda (x) (< x 5)) '(3 9 5 8 2 4 7))
> (3 2 4)
```

#### sort

```clj
(sort f lst)
```

Sort list lst using comparison function f. Example:

```clj
(sort < '(5 6 2 1 5 63 33 7 7 8))
> (1 2 5 5 6 7 7 8 33 63)

(sort > '(5 6 2 1 5 63 33 7 7 8))
> (63 33 8 7 7 6 5 5 2 1)

; Split sentence to words and sort them in ascending order
(sort str-cmp-asc (str-split "this is a string" " "))
> ("a" "is" "string" "this")
```

### String Manipulation

#### str-from-n

```clj
(str-from-n n optFormat)
```

Create a string from the number n. Also takes an optional format argument optFormat that works in the same way as the printf-function in C. The optFormat argument can also be used together with other characters as long as the resulting output string is shorter than 100 characters. Example:

```clj
(str-from-n 10)
> "10"

(str-from-n 2.5)
> "2.500000"

(str-from-n 2.5 "%.1f")
> "2.5"

(str-from-n 10 "0x%04X") ; Here we also append 0x in front of optFormat
> "0x000A"

(str-from-n 0.023e3)
> "2.500000"
```

#### str-merge

```clj
(str-merge str1 str2 ...)
```

Merge a number of strings into one. Example:

```clj
(str-merge "A" "bC" "D")
> "AbCD"

(str-merge "Num1: " (str-from-n 10) " Num2: " (str-from-n 2.1 "%.1f"))
> "Num1: 10 Num2: 2.1"
```

#### str-to-i

```clj
(str-to-i str optBase)
```

Convert string to integer. By default the base is chosen automatically, but it can also be specified. Example:

```clj
(str-to-i "123")
> {123}

(str-to-i "a" 16)
> {10}

(str-to-i "0xa") ; Automatic base16 if str starts with 0x
> {10}
```

#### str-to-f

```clj
(str-to-f str)
```

Convert string to floating point number. Example:

```clj
(str-to-f "2.5")
> {2.500000}

; Also supports scientific notation
(str-to-f "0.0025e3")
> {2.500000}
```

#### str-part

```clj
(str-part str start optN)
```

Take part of string str starting at start for optN characters. If optN is omitted the rest of str will be taken. Example:

```clj
(str-part "Hello World!" 6)
> "World!"

(str-part "Hello World!" 6 2)
> "Wo"

(str-part "Hello World!" 0 2)
> "He"
```

#### str-split

```clj
(str-split str delim)
```

Split string str into tokens using delimiter delim. If delim is a number str will be split into tokens the size of that number. Example:

```clj
(str-split "This is a test" " ")
> ("This" "is" "a" "test")

(str-split "this_o_is_o_a_o_test" "_o_")
> ("This" "is" "a" "test")

(str-split "This is a test" 3)
> ("Thi" "s i" "s a" " te" "st")

(str-split "This is a test" 1)
> ("T" "h" "i" "s" " " "i" "s" " " "a" " " "t" "e" "s" "t")
```

#### str-replace

```clj
(str-replace str rep optWith)
```

Replace every occurrence of rep in str with optWith. If optWith is omitted every rep will be removed. Example:

```clj
(str-replace "Hello World!" "World" "LispBM")
> "Hello LispBM!"

(str-replace "Hello World!" " World")
> "Hello!"
```

#### str-to-upper

```clj
(str-to-upper str)
```

Convert string str to upper case. Example:

```clj
(str-to-upper "TesTt")
> "TESTT"
```

#### str-to-lower

```clj
(str-to-lower str)
```

Convert string str to lower case. Example:

```clj
(str-to-lower "TesTt")
> "testt"
```

#### str-cmp

```clj
(str-cmp str1 str1)
```

Compare strings str1 and str2. Works in the same way as the strcmp-function in C, meaning that equal strings return 0 and different strings return their difference according how they would be sorted. Example:

```clj
(str-cmp "Hello" "Hello")
> 0

(str-cmp "Hello" "World")
> -15

(str-cmp "World" "Hello")
> 15
```

#### str-cmp-asc

```clj
(str-cmp-asc str1 str1)
```

Return true if str1 comes before str2, nil otherwise. Useful for sorting strings using the [sort](#sort) function in ascending order.

#### str-cmp-dsc

```clj
(str-cmp-dsc str1 str1)
```

Return true if str2 comes before str1, nil otherwise. Useful for sorting strings using the [sort](#sort) function in descending order.

#### str-len

```clj
(str-len str)
```

Calculate length of string str excluding the null termination. Example:

```clj
(str-len "Hello")
> 5
```

## Events

Events can be used to execute code for certain events, such as when CAN-frames are received. To use events you must first register an event handler, then enable the events you want to receive. As the event handler blocks until the event arrives it is useful to spawn a thread to handle events so that other things can be done in the main thread at the same time.

The following example shows how to spawn a thread that handles SID (standard-id) CAN-frames and custom app data:

```clj
(define proc-sid (lambda (id data)
    (print (list id data)) ; Print the ID and data
))

(define proc-data (lambda (data)
    (progn
        (print data)
)))

(define event-handler (lambda ()
    (progn
        (recv ((event-can-sid (? id) . (? data)) (proc-sid id data))
        (recv ((event-data-rx ? data) (proc-data data))
              (_ nil)) ; Ignore other events
        (event-handler) ; Call self again to make this a loop
)))

; Spawn the event handler thread and pass the ID it returns to C
(event-register-handler (spawn event-handler))

; Enable the CAN event for standard ID (SID) frames
(event-enable 'event-can-sid)

; Enable the custom app data event
(event-enable 'event-data-rx)
```

Possible events to register are

```clj
(event-enable 'event-can-sid) ; Sends (signal-can-sid id data), where id is U32 and data is a byte array
(event-enable 'event-can-eid) ; Sends (signal-can-eid id data), where id is U32 and data is a byte array
(event-enable 'event-data-rx) ; Sends (signal-data-rx data), where data is a byte array
```

The CAN-frames arrive whenever data is received on the CAN-bus and data-rx is received for example when data is sent from a Qml-script in VESC Tool.

## Byte Arrays

Byte arrays (and text strings) are allocated in memory as consecutive arrays of bytes (not linked lists). They can be shared with C and are more space and performance efficient than linked lists. Several of the extensions also take byte arrays as input as an alternative to lists and some of the events return byte arrays.

To allocate a byte array with 20 bytes and bind the symbol arr to it you can use

```clj
(define arr (array-create 20))
```

#### buflen

The length of a byte array can be read with

```clj
(buflen arr)
```

Which will return 20 for the array arr above.

#### bufclear

To clear a byte array the function bufclear can be used:

```clj
(bufclear arr optByte optStart optLen)
```

Where arr is the byte array to clear, optByte is the optional argument of what to clear with (default 0), optStart is the optional argument of which position to start clearing (default 0) and optLen is the optional argument of how many bytes to clear after start (default the entire array). Example:

```clj
(bufclear arr) ; Clear all of arr
(bufclear arr 0xFF) ; Fill arr with 0xFF
(bufclear arr 0 5) ; Clear from index 5 to the end
(bufclear arr 0 5 10) ; Clear 10 bytes starting from index 5
(bufclear arr 0xAA 5 10) ; Set 10 bytes to 0xAA starting from index 5
```

#### bufget-\[x\]

To read data from the byte array you can use

```clj
(bufget-[x] arr index)
```

Where \[x\] is i8, u8, i16, u16, i32, u32 or f32. Index is the position in the array to start reading from, starting at 0. Here are some examples

```clj
(bufget-i8 arr 0) ; read byte 0 as int8
(bufget-i16 arr 0) ; read byte 0 and 1 as int16
(bufget-i32 arr 0) ; read byte 0 to 3 as i32
(bufget-u8 arr 0) ; read byte 0 as uint8
(bufget-u16 arr 0) ; read byte 0 and 1 as uint16
(bufget-u24 arr 0) ; read byte 0, 1 and 2 as uint24
(bufget-u32 arr 0) ; read byte 0 to 3 as uint32
(bufget-f32 arr 0) ; read byte 0 to 3 as float32 (IEEE 754)
```

By default the byte order is big endian. The byte order can also be specified as an extra argument. E.g. to read 4 bytes as int32 from position 6 in little endian you can use

```clj
(bufget-i32 arr 6 'little-endian)
```

#### bufset-\[x\]

Writing to the array can be done in a similar way

```clj
(bufset-[x] arr index value)
```

Here are some examples

```clj
(bufset-i8 arr 0 12) ; write 12 to byte 0 as int8
(bufset-i16 arr 0 -5621) ; write -5621 to byte 0 and 1 as int16
(bufset-i32 arr 0 2441) ; write 2441 to byte 0 to 3 as i32
(bufset-u8 arr 0 12) ; write 12 to byte 0 as uint8
(bufset-u16 arr 0 420) ; write 420 to byte 0 and 1 as uint16
(bufset-u24 arr 0 420) ; write 420 to byte 0, 1 and 2 as uint24
(bufset-u32 arr 0 119) ; write 119 to byte 0 to 3 as uint32
(bufset-f32 arr 0 3.14) ; write 3.14 to byte 0 to 3 as float32 (IEEE 754)
(bufset-bit arr 14 1) ; Set bit 14 to 1 (note that this is a bitindex)
```

As with bufget big endian is the default byte order and little-endian can be passed as the last argument to use little-endian byte order instead.

#### bufcpy

Copy part of one array into another array.

```clj
(bufcpy arr1 ind1 arr2 ind2 len)
```

Copy len bytes from arr2 starting at ind2 to arr1 starting at ind1. Len will be truncated to ensure that nothing is read or written outside of the arrays.

#### free

Byte arrays will be de-allocated by the garbage collector on a regular basis, but can still use a lot of memory until then and large byte arrays cause a risk of running out of memory. It is possible to manually de-allocate the byte arrays when done with them by calling free

```clj
(free arr)
```

This will clear the allocated memory for arr.

**Note**  
Strings in lispBM are treated the same as byte arrays, so all of the above can be done to the characters in strings too.

## Import Files

Import is a special command that is mostly handled by VESC Tool. When VESC Tool sees a line that imports a file it will open and read that file and attach it as binary data to the end of the uploaded code. VESC Tool also generates a table of the imported files that will be allocated as arrays and passed to LispBM at start and bound to bindings.

Every imported file behaves as a byte array that is read-only (so do not try to modify it). These byte arrays can be used as usual from the lisp code to, for example, load native libraries or to load more lisp code at runtime. As they are stored in flash in raw binary format there is significantly more space available than when using e.g. the array syntax. The lisp script and the imported files can use up to 120 KB together.

#### import

```clj
(import filename binding)
```

Load filename as a byte array and bind it to binding. Note that import must be on its own line and that every line can only have one import.

**Example: Load native library**

```clj
(import "ws2812.bin" 'ws2812) ; Import the native ws2812 library. This creates the byte array ws2812 that can be used usual.
(load-native-lib ws2812); Load it to get the extensions it provides 
```

### Import Paths

Paths for import can be relative or absolute. Absolute paths are always looked up from the root of the file system, but relative paths need to be resolved. If the lisp-file is saved (e.g. there is a path at the bottom of the editor) paths are looked up relative to the location of that lisp file. If they are not found there they are looked up relative to the location where VESC Tool is started. If the file never has been saved (e.g. you just opened a new tab and started typing) the file path is unknown until save as is used, so only the path relative to VESC Tool is looked up then.

### Special Paths

It is also possible to import files from [VESC Packages](https://github.com/vedderb/vesc_pkg) using a special path syntax. If you want to import the lisp-file from a VESC Package you can use the format

```clj
(import "pkg@path/to/package.vescpkg" 'import-name)
```

This will import the lisp-file from that VESC Package. It is also possible to import the imports from a lisp-file in a VESC Package. This is a bit confusing as the package itself does not contain the paths anymore, so instead of referring to the path you have to refer to the label. Here is an example of that:

Suppose you have a VESC Package that has a lisp-file that imports a file like this:

```clj
(import "c_lib/ws2812/ws2812.bin" 'ws2812)
```

To import the file that is imported as ws2812 in the lisp-file of that vesc package you can use

```clj
(import "pkg::ws2812@path/to/package.vescpkg" 'ws2812)
```

This means import the import ws2812 from the lisp file in the VESC Package located at path/to/package.vescpkg.

### Import Official VESC Packages

There is a [github repository](https://github.com/vedderb/vesc_pkg) where official VESC Packages are located. All of the lisp-files and their imports from the packages in this repository can be imported using the special base path **://vesc_packages**. For example, to import the ws2812 import from lib_ws2812 the following import can be used:

```clj
(import "pkg::ws2812@://vesc_packages/lib_ws2812/ws2812.vescpkg" 'ws2812)
```

This should work for all VESC Packages in that repository. Most examples there use this pattern.

**NOTE:** The path above does not download the repository on demand, but relies on the cached local version. This cached version is not updated automatically, so you have to run the update manually when you want to get the latest version of the repository. To update the cache you can use the **Update Archive**-button from the VESC Packages-page in VESC Tool.

## Native Libraries

Native libraries can be used when more performance is needed. They can be created by compiling position-independent C code and loaded/unloaded with the functions below. More care has to be taken when developing native libraries as they have far less sandboxing than lispBM-code, so access to a SWD-programmer is recommended while developing them.

Up to 10 native libraries can be loaded simultaneously and the recommended way to configure and interact with them is by providing LispBM-extensions from them.

Currently the documentation for native libraries is limited, but there are some examples [in this diretory](c_libs/examples). The interface that can be used in native libraries can be found [in this file](c_libs/vesc_c_if.h).

### Features

Native libraries get a list of function pointers that can be used to interact with the rest of the VESC code. The following features are currently supported:

* Register LispBM-extensions.
* Os-functions like sleep, print, malloc, free, system time.
* Create one or more threads.
* GPIO-control (ST and abstract).
* The ST standard peripheral library can be used.
* Send and receive CAN-frames and control other VESCs over CAN-bus.
* Motor control using almost everything from mc_interface.

### Cleanup

Every time lispBM is restarted or when new code is uploaded the native libraries are closed and reloaded, so it is important to do proper cleanup in lib_info->stop_fun when resources such as threads are allocated.

#### load-native-lib

```clj
(load-native-lib lib)
```

Load the native library lib. lib is a byte array with the compiled binary that is created after running make on the native library.

#### unload-native-lib

```clj
(unload-native-lib lib)
```

Unload the native library lib. This is done automatically when lispBM is stopped or restarted, so there is no need to do it explicitly. This function is provided in case native libraries need to be explicitly loaded and unloaded while the same program is running.

### Native Library Example

This example creates an extension called ext-test that takes a number as an argument and returns the number multiplied by 3. The code for it can be found [in this diretory](c_libs/examples/extension).

```clj
; When running make in the example directory a file called example.lisp
; with this array is created.

(def example [
0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x08 0xb5 0x07 0x4b 0x07 0x49 0x08 0x48 0x7b 0x44 0x79 0x44 0x1b 0x68 0x03 0x4b
0x78 0x44 0x1b 0x68 0x98 0x47 0x01 0x20 0x08 0xbd 0x00 0xbf 0x00 0xf8 0x00 0x10 0xf0 0xff 0xff 0xff
0x2b 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x18 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x65 0x78 0x74 0x2d 0x74 0x65 0x73 0x74 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00
0x01 0x29 0x70 0xb5 0x05 0x46 0x09 0x4c 0x0d 0xd1 0xe3 0x6f 0x00 0x68 0x98 0x47 0x48 0xb1 0x63 0x6e
0x28 0x68 0x26 0x6c 0x98 0x47 0x33 0x46 0x00 0xeb 0x40 0x00 0xbd 0xe8 0x70 0x40 0x18 0x47 0xd4 0xf8
0x94 0x00 0x70 0xbd 0x00 0xf8 0x00 0x10
])

; The array can be loaded like this

(load-native-lib example)

; Now an extension called ext-test is available. Here we use it
; with the argument 4 and print the result

(print (ext-test 4)) ; Should print 12
```

## UAVCAN

#### uavcan-last-rawcmd

```clj
(uavcan-last-rawcmd canInterface)
```

Get the last raw uavcan-command and its age. Returns a list where the first element is the value and the second element is the age. canInterface is the interface, which can be 1 or 2. Interface 2 is only valid if the hardware has dual CAN-buses. Example:

```clj
(print (ix (uavcan-last-rawcmd 1) 0)) ; Print the value
(print (ix (uavcan-last-rawcmd 1) 1)) ; Print the age in seconds
```

#### uavcan-last-rpmcmd

```clj
(uavcan-last-rpmcmd canInterface)
```

Same as uavcan-last-rawcmd, but for the last rpm-command.

## LispBM

#### lbm-set-quota

```clj
(lbm-set-quota quota)
```

Set how many evaluation steps to run each thread between context switches. Default is 50. A lower value will alter between threads more often, reducing latency between context switches at the cost of overall performance. The default value of 50 has relatively low performance overhead. Setting the quota to the lowest possible value of 1, meaning that each thread gets to run one step at a time, roughly halves the performance.

Lowering this value is useful if there are one or more timing-critical threads (that e.g. read encoders) that cannot wait too long between iterations.

## Plotting

VESC Tool can be used for plotting data using the Realtime Data->Experiment page. The following commands are used to set up a plot and send data.

#### plot-init

```clj
(plot-init namex namey)
```

Start a new plot with namex as the x axis name and namey as the u axis name.

#### plot-add-graph

```clj
(plot-add-graph name)
```

Add a graph to the current plot that will be called name. Every added graph gets a new index, starting from 0.

#### plot-set-graph

```clj
(plot-set-graph ind)
```

Set graph index to which data points are sent.

#### plot-send-points

```clj
(plot-send-points x y)
```

Send a xy-point to the selected graph in the plot.

## How to update

To update from remote repository:

```bash
git remote add lispBM git@github.com:svenssonjoel/lispBM.git
git subtree pull --squash --prefix=lispBM/lispBM/ lispBM master
```

The first command might fail if it already is added, but the second one should still work. If there are uncomitted changes you can run **git stash** before the commands and **git stash pop** after them.
